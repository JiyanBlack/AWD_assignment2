        <p class="subtitle">Project Design</p>
        <p>
            Our websites have total 7 pages, half of them are built on React.
        </p>
        <p>
            Index page: introduction to our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Login page: user login.
        </p>
        <p>
            Register page: register new user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Profile page: display a user's profile, including friends, viewed history and hobbies graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Match page: change match preference, display match result and graphs. User can also add friends within the top 10 matches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chatting page: A real-time chat application for the user to chat with all friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aboutus page: documentation of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chat app: Users can chat with friends using chat app,when a friend is online, it will update in left friend list, a user
            can click on left friend name and send messages, both send button and "enter" key press is workable for sending,
            when a user is offline and messages are sent to him, the messages are stored in server database and it will show
            the number of unread messages on the left panel when he logs in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Authentication: When a user registers or logs in with username and password, on page javascript will first check the name
            and password meet basic requirements, then if they are valid, it will generate a hash from username and password
            and send to server, server store the hash for later comparison of login, server will set a session to keep userid,
            during chating socket io will also check user session to authenticate user sending and receiving of messages.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">Architecture</p>
        <p>
            We have several important architecture and decisions:
        </p>
        <p>1. We decide to user React.js as our main front-end framework.</p>
        <p>2. Websocket is responsible for all front-back end communications.</p>
        <p>3. MongoDB and Mongoose is driving our database.</p>
        <p>4. Sessions are used to keep a secure communication including real-time chat.</p>
        <p>5. Babel and Webpack are responsible for pre-compile all front-end js from ES6 to more compatible ES5 style.</p>
        <p>6. Mocha, Enzyme and Chai are used for testing.</p>
        <p>7. Express is used as our server framework.</p>
        <p>8. Flux is used for manage chat information.</p>
