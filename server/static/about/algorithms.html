        <p class="title">Matching Algorithm</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Data Structure</p>
        <p>
            When we get the user's hobbies, all entries are flattend into a 1-d array of 0s and 1s with 71 entries. Each of the 0 and
            1 is mapping to a hobby, 1 mean user has this hobby while 0 means not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The typical user interests array is like: [0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0....1].
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">The Algorithm</p>
        <p>
            The algorithm is based on the matching mark rules. There are three rules:
        </p>
        </p>
        Rule 1: if two person both like the same hobby, add 10 to the mark;
        </p>
        </p>
        Rule 2: if two person both dislike the same hobby, add 2 to the mark;
        </p>
        </p>
        Rule 3: if two person both do not have the same preference, reduce 1 from the mark;
