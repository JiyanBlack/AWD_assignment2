        <p class="title">Difficulties and Challenges</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Overview</p>
        <p>
            There are many difficulties that we have encountered during this project. Most of them are caused by overly ambitious planning.
            The rentless persuit of the art-of-state technology stack leads to lots of potential conundrums. However during
            the process of the project, we also learnt a lot by taking those latest technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another big problem is that when combining the different functionalities to the same webpage, Javascript codes becomes very
            unfriendly for debugging. Lots of errors are omitted. To get rid of as much callbacks as possible, we are trying
            to save ourselves by Promise.js(including the promise in Mongoose). Also mongoDB with mongoose is very unfriendly
            for debugging, lots of error information went silent event we add console.log(err).
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">Front-end</p>
        <p>
            The major problem of the front-end is combining React with other packages(socket, webpack...), we figured out the most comfortable
            way of using react are: enabling webpack-dev-server, using ES6 syntax to manage packages and packing all logics
            into JSX.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also find that using this.props, this.state and this.setState is really neat when we are used to. The data flow becomes
            easy to maintain. This enables one or two people to build websites with lots of data flowing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For plotting nice graphs, we use Highcharts.js. However, Highcharts.js needs to be rendered after all dom elements are loaded.
            React lifecycle management becomes another whole big issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            React is good once you know it. But for small projects, it is probably not worth learning React because it is a whole set
            of new tools and theories. As I said, once you know it, React becomes very powerful and fast. But it will take
            lots of time.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">Back-end</p>
        <p>
            We found back-end is relatively easier. We use websocket to communicate whenever possible. All visualization data, chatting
            messages, friends lists and viewed lists are hot-loading by websocket.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are using sessions for the validation part. But we found that when applying sessions middleware for socket connections,
            sometime the socket information cannot reach the server side. This is a problem that we have not fixed yet. This
            is probably due to we use the session middleware as the middleware of express.js as well as websocket.io.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also when it comes to the testing, React has a total different sets of testing tools. This took us lots of time to figure
            out.
